## Week 1. day 3. 2017-1-11

- Finish design file.<br>
- Look at more examples for audio recording code.<br>
-  Make my own microphone recording webpage.<br>

## Week 1, day 4. 2017-1-12

Planned:<br>
- Take microphone with me, test selection of two audio sources<br>
- Save microphone recording<br>
- Fix gain of audio<br>

Reality: <br>
- Took microphone with me, selection audio source seems impossible to implement.<br>
- Fast Fourier Transform audio signal<br>


## Week 1, day 5. 2017-1-13

Planned:<br>
- Fast Fourier Transform audio signal<br>
- Time Fast Fourier Transform<br>

Reality:<br>
- We put almost all our time into the presentation<br>
- Timing doesn't seem to be necissary.<br>

## Week 2, day 1. 2017-1-16

Planned:<br>
- Plot buffer output<br>
Reality:<br>
- Plotted buffer output!<br>
- Plotted FFT results<br>


## Week 2, day 2. 2017-1-17

Planned:<br>
- Change Plot FFT<br>

Reality:<br>
- Looked into data represented in FFT plot. <br>
- Log transformed x-axis.<br>
- Calculated note name frequencies.<br>
- Put note name labels on correct place in FFT plot.<br>
- Looked into clearing up FFT results with gain.<br>

## Week 2, day 3. 2017-1-18

Planned:<br>
- change Plot FFT, Stack plots.<br>
- Save FFT into matrix and plot heatmap.<br>

Reality:<br>
- At home and sick<br>

## Week 2, day 4. 2017-1-16

Planned:<br>
- Plot heatmap <br>
- Add interactivity sliders (gain, zoom, analysis-time)<br>

Reality: <br>
- Saved FFT into matrix<br>
- Plotted heatmap<br>
- Log transformed heatmap y/freq-axis<br>

## Week 2, day 5. 2017-1-17

Planned:<br>
- Add interactivity sliders (gain, zoom, analysis-time)<br>
- Add axis to heatmap<br>

Reality:<br>
- Spent most time for presentation again.<br>

## Week 3, day 1.

Planned:<br>
- Add interactivity tick (smoothed view)<br>
- Implement spiral FFT plot.<br>
- Add buttons to switch plot type.<br>

Reality:<br>
- Trouble with FFT spiral plot and stacking plot<br>
- Made an implementation for spiral plotting in Matlab<br>

## Week 3, day 2.

Planned:<br>
- Spiral FFT plot.<br>

Reality:<br>
- Heatmap placement corrected and axis added<br>
- Correct frequency/y-axis implemented<br>
- Correct x-axis implemented<br>
- Zoom slider for heatmap implemented!<br>

## Week 3, day 3.

Planned: <br>
- Spiral FFT plot.<br>

Reality: <br>
- Fixed small bug that caused heatmap to plot incorrectly and boring.
- Inproved performance of Matlab spiral plot.
- Tried to implement 1-octave per spiral spiral in Matlab, but failed.

## Week 3, day 4.

Planned: <br>
- Spiral FFT plot.<br>
- Smoothing signal option.<br>

Reality: <br>
- Fixed small bug that caused frequencies in the heatmap to be an octave to low.<br>
- Made the axis prettier.<br>
- Implemented stacking of FFT results!<br>
- Implemented temporal walking average smoothing with switch button!<br>
