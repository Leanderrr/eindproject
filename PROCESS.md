## Week 1. day 3. 2017-1-11

++ Finish design file.<br>
++ Look at more examples for audio recording code.<br>
+-  Make my own microphone recording webpage.<br>

## Week 1, day 4. 2017-1-12

Planned:
- Take microphone with me, test selection of two audio sources
- Save microphone recording
- Fix gain of audio
Reality: 
- Took microphone with me, selection audio source seems impossible to implement.
- Fast Fourier Transform audio signal


## Week 1, day 5. 2017-1-13

Planned:
- Fast Fourier Transform audio signal
- Time Fast Fourier Transform
Reality:
- We put almost all our time into the presentation
- Timing doesn't seem to be necissary.

## Week 2, day 1. 2017-1-16

Planned:
- Plot buffer output
Reality:
- Plotted buffer output!
- Plotted FFT results


## Week 2, day 2. 2017-1-17

Planned:
- Change Plot FFT
Reality:
- Looked into data represented in FFT plot. 
- Log transformed x-axis.
- Calculated note name frequencies.
- Put note name labels on correct place in FFT plot.
- Looked into clearing up FFT results with gain.


## Week 2, day 3. 2017-1-18

Planned:
change Plot FFT, Stack plots.
Save FFT into matrix and plot heatmap.

## Week 2, day 4. 2017-1-16

Planned:
Plot heatmap 
Add interactivity sliders (gain, zoom, analysis-time)

## Week 2, day 5. 2017-1-17

Planned:
- Add interactivity sliders (gain, zoom, analysis-time)

## Week 3, day 1.

Planned:
- Add interactivity tick (smoothed view)
- Implement spiral FFT plot.
- Add buttons to switch plot type.

## Week 3, day 2.

Planned:
- Spiral FFT plot.


## Week 3, day 3.

Planned: 
- Spiral FFT plot.
